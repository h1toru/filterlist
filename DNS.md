# DNS Services

List of recommended DNS Services.

The DNS services in this list are chosen based on several factors like speed, security, privacy and transparency; and also filters (domain blocking) availability which is for me is the most important part of using DNS Service.

**Note: Services listed in order from most recommended to least**

### Notes
- **EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)** makes DNS communication less private and reduce the efficiency of DNS caching. So it is recommended to not use/enable it.<br>
  > See: https://adguard-dns.io/en/blog/privacy-friendly-edns-client-subnet.html
- Mullvad, dnswarden, RethinkDNS; Plain DNS cannot be used as *Plain DNS* (TCP/53 or UDP/53).
- Quad9 unfiltered server (`9.9.9.10`) doesn't support DNSSEC which is a big downside for better security.
- RethinkDNS DoH (`sky.rethinkdns.com`) doesn't have static IP, so the IPs may change anytime. The Plain DNS is only for DoT (`max.rethinkdns.com`).
  > See: serverless-dns/serverless-dns#84
- dnswarden and RethinkDNS often have connection lost on Android's built-in Private DNS.
- Based on my personal experiences, DNS-over-HTTPS/3 are way faster than DoT in term of speed.

## Unfiltered
Doesn't block or filters anything.

## Adblock
Blocks Ads, Tracker, etc.

#### Default
Filterlists are decided by the DNS provider. Users wouldn't know which filterlists is used and in most cases, it's not really effective to block ads.

| Provider | IPv4 | IPv6 | DNS-over-HTTPS/3| DNS-over-TLS/QUIC |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| ControlD | 76.76.2.2 <br> 76.76.10.2 | 2606:1a40::2 <br> 2606:1a40:1::2 | `https://freedns.controld.com/p2` | `p2.freedns.controld.com` |
| AdGuard | 94.140.14.14 <br> 94.140.15.15 | 2a10:50c0::ad1:ff <br> 2a10:50c0::ad2:ff | `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query` | `dns.adguard-dns.com` |
| MullvadDNS | 194.242.2.4 <br> 2a07:e340::4 | `https://base.dns.mullvad.net/dns-query` | `base.dns.mullvad.net` |
| dnswarden | 149.248.217.117 | | `https://dns.dnswarden.com/adblock` | `adblock.dns.dnswarden.com` |

#### Minimal
Uses minimal filters that is enough to block ads and trackers.

| Provider | Filter | IPv4 | IPv6 | DNS-over-HTTPS/3| DNS-over-TLS/QUIC |
| :- | :- | :- | :- | :- | :- |
| dnswarden | Peter Lowe's Filter | 149.248.217.117 | | `https://dns.dnswarden.com/0000000000000008` | `0000000000000008.dns.dnswarden.com` |
| RethinkDNS | Peter Lowe's Filter, URLhaus Filter | 137.66.7.89 (**DoT only**) | 2a09:8280:1::3:6e18 (**DoT only**) | `https://sky.rethinkdns.com/1:QBBAAEAA` | `1-iaieaacaaa.max.rethinkdns.com` |

#### Effective (Recommended)
Uses HaGeZi's Multi Pro filterlist which is the most effective filters to block any sort of ads and trackers.
